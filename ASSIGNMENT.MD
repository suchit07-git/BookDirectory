## Tasks

### 1. Read individual books üìñ

  - Create a `GET` request to get the information of a particular book.
  - Display all the information of this book on a new/same page.
  - Hyperlink each book displayed on the `/books` page to this. 
  Clicking this book must lead to the individual book's information. For instance, clicking book 1 must lead to `/books/1`

### 2. Edit an existing book üìù

  - Provide an edit button for each book. 
  - Upon clicking this, user must be able to see a form (similar to the form on `/add`). This form must be already filled with the details of the book we are trying to edit.
  - Create a `PATCH` or `PUT` request to update the details of this book.

### 3. Delete an existing book üóëÔ∏è

  - Create a `DELETE` request to delete a book by its id.
  - You are free to provide a delete button wherever suitable.

### 4. Show Bestselling books üîñ (Optional)

  - Add a new `boolean` field called `bestseller` to the `bookSchema`.
  - Create a new page to display only the bestselling books. This would mean fetching only those books from our database that have `bestseller` set to `true`.
